A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. How many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table?

Let's convert the page size to bytes: 8 KB = 2^13 B.
From that converting we know that offset is 13 bits.
Number of virtual pages = number of entries in page table = 2^(16-13) = 2^3 = 8
